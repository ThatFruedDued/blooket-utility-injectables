## BlooketUI (by smintf)
Try out this external injectable, giving you a custom Blooket cheat UI! Injectable URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blooketware/BlooketUI/main/blooket-utility/injectable.json`

## Update
Please view the main repository (https://github.com/ThatFruedDued/blooket-utility) for details on how to use these. Also, please note that any injectables that have a `.js` ending instead of being a folder are **outdated** and will **not** work with the current utility. Currently, the only injectable that applies here is the `glixzzy.js` injectable.
